# vagrant

Vagrant based development environment

## Requirements

## Requirements

* Vagrant 2.2.5 or greater (important, will not work with older vagrant versions)
* Docker 18.09.7 or greater
* vagrant plugin: https://github.com/devopsgroup-io/vagrant-hostmanager
* vagrant plugin: ```vagrant plugin install docker-api```
* vagrant plugin: https://github.com/ProxiBlue/vagrant-communicator-docker

## Install

* Clone this repo: 

```git clone -b docker --recursive git@github.com:uptactics/vagrant.git```

*** This will checkout EVERYTHING - INCLUDES THE SITE CODE UNDER sites FOLDER

* cd into the new folder (called vagrant) 

```cd vagrant```

* set your DEV DOMAIN

```export DEV_DOMAIN=uptactics.test```

You can set this as a global ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE in your host OS
If none set, will default to uptactics.test

* bring up the DNS server



* bring the server up 

```vagrant up```

That is it. The vagrant virtual machine will now boot

## Access

* You can ssh to the vagrant box ussing:

```vagrant ssh```

## Site Code

Files are stored here: 

```/vagrant/sites``` (from within the VM after you ssh'd into vm)
```./sites``` (from within the folder you had cloned at the start of this process)

## Boostrap (initial vagrant up after a vagrant destroy / first time run)

* The VM build process will create the initial local.xml files (located in /sites/[magento root]/app/etc) for you. 
  This file is a symlink to local.xml.dev
* If the local.xml file does not exist, it will also create the database for each site (as noted in the the lcoal.xml file) 

## Site Database setups

This will need to be done after any ```vagrant destroy``` was used, or on intial setup, after ```vagrant up``` was used. 

* By whatever means you are comfortable with, create SQL dumps of each site (from live, uat etc)
* Download those from the remote servers, and place each into the ```sites[magento root]``` folder, obviously matching each    to the given site + dump file

* Now ssh into the vagrant VM using 

```vagrant ssh```

* cd to each site folder, and initiate a db import, for example, to import NTOTANK

```cd /vagrant/sites/ntotank```
```n98-magerun db:import ./dataBasedump.sql```

(If you get an error of database not existing, use ```n98-magerun db:create``` to create the db)

* next run the database migrate scripts

```cd shell```
```/bin/bash ./mage_db_to_dev.sh```

* sites wil be assigned IPS:

    * 172.17.0.100 : ntotank
    * 172.17.0.111 : protank
    * 172.17.0.121 : pvcpipesupplies
    * 172.17.0.122 : sprayersupplies
    * 172.17.0.123 : pvcm2

* ensure all site urls are present

## Browse the sites

You should now be able to browse to each site via your browser

## RESET ALL SITE / REDO BASE SETUP

At anytime, if you feel the sites require a kick to rehash something, run the *provisioning* via vagrant, or if you had wiped a sites folder, and re-cloned the entire site from github.

cd to the top level vagrant folder```
run the commands: 

```vagrant halt```
```vagrant up --provision```

All build of sites will run.

*this will not destroy the dbs* so there is no need to re-run the db setup scripts, but it will not cause an issue if you do.
